It consists of over 1.5 million article and summary pairs, covering a diverse range of topics and domains. The dataset is designed to facilitate research in the area of extreme summarization, where the goal is to generate a summary of a large number of documents (e.g., hundreds or thousands) that is both concise and informative. The dataset is split into train, validation, and test sets, and is available in English."

dataset_summary: "Indic-XNLI is a natural language inference (NLI) corpus covering 11 languages from the Indian subcontinent. It is a translation of the English XNLI corpus, which is an extension of the MultiNLI corpus. The goal of the task is to predict whether a given pair of sentences are entailment, contradiction, or neutral. The dataset is useful for evaluating the performance of cross-lingual models on the NLI task in Indian languages."

A Multilingual Dataset for Causal Commonsense Reasoning\nThe Cross-lingual Choice of Plausible Alternatives dataset is a benchmark to evaluate the ability of machine learning models to transfer commonsense reasoning across\nlanguages. The dataset is the translation and reannotation of the English COPA (Roemmele et al. 2011) and covers 11 languages from 11 families and several areas around\nthe globe. The dataset is challenging as it requires both the command of world knowledge and the ability to generalise to new languages. All the details about the\ncreation of XCOPA and the implementation of the baselines are available in the paper."

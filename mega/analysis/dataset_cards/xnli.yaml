dataset_summary: XNLI is a subset of a few thousand examples from MNLI which has been translated
into a 14 different languages (some low-ish resource). As with MNLI, the goal is
to predict textual entailment (does sentence A imply/contradict/neither sentence
B) and is a classification task (given two sentences, predict one of three
labels).
